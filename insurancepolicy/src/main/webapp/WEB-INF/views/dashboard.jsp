		<p>There is no denying that you will have greater peace of mind if
			you know that you and your loved ones are financially secure from
			various unforeseen situations. Uncertainties in life could crop up at
			any moment, such as an unfortunate death or a medical emergency.
			These situations also include an accident or damage to your vehicle,
			property, etc.</p>
		<p>Bearing the financial impact of these situations can burn a
			hole into your pocket. You may need to dip into your savings or your
			familyâ€™s hard-earned money. Thus, there is a pressing need of
			insurance for you and your family for proper coverage and financial
			support against all risks linked to your life, health and property.</p>
		<h3>Need for Insurance</h3>
		<ul>
			<p>Insurance plans are beneficial to anyone looking to protect
				their family, assets/property and themselves from financial
				risk/losses:</p>
			<li><p>Insurance plans will help you pay for medical
					emergencies, hospitalisation, contraction of any illnesses and
					treatment, and medical care required in the future.</p></li>
			<li><p>The financial loss to the family due to the
					unfortunate death of the sole earner can be covered by insurance
					plans. The family can also repay any debts like home loans or other
					debts which the person insured may have incurred in his/her
					lifetime</p></li>
			<li><p>Insurance plans will help your family maintain their
					standard of living in case you are not around in the future. This
					will help them cover the costs of running the household through the
					insurance lump sum payout. The insurance money will give your
					family some much-needed breathing space along with coverage for all
					expenditure in case of death/accident/medical emergency of the
					policyholder</p></li>
			<li><p>Many insurance plans come with savings and investment
					schemes along with regular coverage. These help in building
					wealth/savings for the future through regular investments. You pay
					premiums regularly and a portion of the same goes towards life
					coverage while the other portion goes towards either a savings plan
					or investment plan, whichever you choose based on your future goals
					and needs</p></li>
			<li><p>Insurance helps protect your home in the event of any
					unforeseen calamity or damage. Your home insurance plan will help
					you get coverage for damages to your home and pay for the cost of
					repairs or rebuilding, whichever is needed. If you have coverage
					for valuables and items inside the house, then you can purchase
					replacement items with the insurance money</p></li>
